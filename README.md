# GenP-2.7

Reversed source code for GenP v2.7. 

I did this because I was cursious how it works, I thought someone else might be interested too so I am making it public. Be sure to use responsibly.

## Overview

`Adobe-GenP-2.7.exe` displays the GUI, it invokes `GenPPP-2.7.exe` for patching when the patch (cure) button is pressed.

The executables `RunMe.exe`, `Adobe-GenP-2.7.exe`, `GenPPP-2.7.exe`, and `HotkeySet.exe` are actually AutoIt scripts.
